# Awesome-NCA


A curated list of anything related to Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) research, frameworks and applications.

NCA are a new type of neural architecture, marrying concepts of traditional cellular automata and feed forward neural networks.
This list is a curated collection of research papers and code repositories, presenting new ideas and applications for NCA.

Scope: Other types of self-organizing systems, traditional cellular automata, other deep learning techiques are not covered,
unless they utilize a cellular automaton with a learned rule at some point.
