# Awesome NCA

A curated list of anything related to Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) research, frameworks and applications.

NCA are a new type of neural architecture, marrying cellular automata and neural networks to create memory-efficient, robust models.
Mostly, NCAs are applied in image segmentation, classification and generation.
However, there are also works that use NCAs for reinforcement learning or generation of three-dimensional structures.
This list is a curated collection of research papers and code repositories, presenting ideas and applications for NCA.

Scope: Other types of self-organizing systems, traditional cellular automata, other deep learning techiques are not covered, unless they utilize a cellular automaton with a learned rule in their computation.
Review papers are not listed here, unless they are reviews of Neural Cellular Automata in particular (no reviews of, e.g., self-organizing systems in general that mention NCA).

You are welcome to [contribute](#contributing) if you've found other NCA papers, code repositories or resources that you like to share.
